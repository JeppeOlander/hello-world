# hello-world
The answer is 42 but what is the real question?

My name is Jeppe, I am from Denmark and have thrown my love and future passion over the arduino and open-source concept.
I have a background as an electrician, marine engineer and power engineer. Furthermore I have taken different courses of project management and other courses fitted together with my educations.

The next step for me is to Proof a Concept to be used in my not yet started company together with a friend.

GitHub will be a place to share in some extend the ideas and development for seeking advice but also in the future to help others.
I am a huge fan of helping and sharing ideas with others and then be able to let both parties grow instead of locking the idea into a dark and silent room where nobody ever get access and the idea it self will never find its way to the outside and blosom.
